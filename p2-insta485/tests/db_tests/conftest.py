"""
Shared test fixtures.

Pytest will automatically run the db_setup_teardown() function before a
test.  A test should use "db_connnection" as an input, because the name of the
fixture is "db_connection".

EXAMPLE:
>>> def test_simple(db_connection):
>>>     schema_sql = pathlib.Path("sql/schema.sql").read_text(encoding='utf-8')
>>>     data_sql = pathlib.Path("sql/data.sql").read_text(encoding='utf-8')
>>>     db_connection.executescript(schema_sql)
>>>     db_connection.executescript(data_sql)
>>>     db_connection.commit()
