"""
Shared test fixtures.

Pytest will automatically run the client_setup_teardown() function before a
test.  A test should use "client" as an input, because the name of the fixture
is "client".

EXAMPLE:
>>> def test_simple(client):
>>>     response = client.get("/")
>>>     assert response.status_code == 200
