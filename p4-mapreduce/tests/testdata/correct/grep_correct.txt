And when men live by trade with reason not force as their final arbiter it is the best product that wins the best performance the man of best judgment and highest ability and the degree of a mans productiveness is the degree of his reward
Have you ever looked for the root of production
Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value Money is not the tool of the moochers who claim your product by tears or of the looters who take it from you by force
Money is the scourge of the men who attempt to reverse the law of causality the men who seek to replace the mind by seizing the products of the mind
Wealth is the product of mans capacity to think
When you accept money in payment for your effort you do so only on the conviction that you will exchange it for the product of the effort of others
