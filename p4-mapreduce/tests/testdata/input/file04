When you accept money in payment for your effort you do so only on the conviction that you will exchange it for the product of the effort of others
It is not the moochers or the looters who give value to money
Not an ocean of tears not all the guns in the world can transform those pieces of paper in your wallet into the bread you will need to survive tomorrow
Those pieces of paper which should have been gold are a token of honor your claim upon the energy of the men who produce 
Your wallet is your statement of hope that somewhere in the world around you there are men who will not default on that moral principle which is the root of money
Is this what you consider evil
