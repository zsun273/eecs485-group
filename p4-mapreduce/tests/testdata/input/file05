Have you ever looked for the root of production
Take a look at an electric generator and dare tell yourself that it was created by the muscular effort of unthinking brutes
Try to grow a seed of wheat without the knowledge left to you by men who had to discover it for the first time
Try to obtain your food by means of nothing but physical motions and youll learn that mans mind is the root of all the goods produced and of all the wealth that has ever existed on earth
