So you think that money is the root of all evil said Francisco dAnconia
Have you ever asked what is the root of money Money is a tool of exchange which cant exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them
Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value Money is not the tool of the moochers who claim your product by tears or of the looters who take it from you by force
Money is made possible only by the men who produce
Is this what you consider evil
