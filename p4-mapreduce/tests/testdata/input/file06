But you say that money is made by the strong at the expense of the weak
What strength do you mean
It is not the strength of guns or muscles
Wealth is the product of mans capacity to think
Then is money made by the man who invents a motor at the expense of those who did not invent it
Is money made by the intelligent at the expense of the fools
By the able at the expense of the incompetent
By the ambitious at the expense of the lazy
Money is made before it can be looted or mooched made by the effort of every honest man each to the extent of his ability
An honest man is one who knows that he cant consume more than he has produced
