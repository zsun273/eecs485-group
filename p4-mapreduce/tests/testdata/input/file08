But money is only a tool
It will take you wherever you wish but it will not replace you as the driver
It will give you the means for the satisfaction of your desires but it will not provide you with desires
Money is the scourge of the men who attempt to reverse the law of causality the men who seek to replace the mind by seizing the products of the mind
