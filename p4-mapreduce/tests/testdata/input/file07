To trade by means of money is the code of the men of good will
Money rests on the axiom that every man is the owner of his mind and his effort
Money allows no power to prescribe the value of your effort except the voluntary choice of the man who is willing to trade you his effort in return
Money permits you to obtain for your goods and your labor that which they are worth to the men who buy them but no more
Money permits no deals except those to mutual benefit by the unforced judgment of the traders
Money demands of you the recognition that men must work for their own benefit not for their own injury for their gain not their loss the recognition that they are not beasts of burden born to carry the weight of your misery that you must offer them values not wounds that the common bond among men is not the exchange of suffering but the exchange of goods
Money demands that you sell not your weakness to mens stupidity but your talent to their reason it demands that you buy not the shoddiest they offer but the best that your money can find
And when men live by trade with reason not force as their final arbiter it is the best product that wins the best performance the man of best judgment and highest ability and the degree of a mans productiveness is the degree of his reward
This is the code of existence whose tool and symbol is money
Is this what you consider evil
